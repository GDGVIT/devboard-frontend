## üöÄ Features

### Widget Builder
- **Premium Canvas Sizes**: Choose from preset sizes (Badge, Stats Card, Banner, Square, Large Display) or set custom dimensions.

- **GitHub Data Integration**: Fetch live GitHub stats (username, name, bio, followers, following, public repos, avatar, creation date, commits) and display them dynamically in widgets.
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click elements to edit text inline with a beautiful, responsive editor.
- **Layer Management**: Organize, lock/unlock, and toggle visibility for each element. View all layers in a sidebar.
- **Grid & Snap**: Toggle grid visibility, adjust grid size, and enable snap-to-grid for precise placement.
- **Theme Switching**: Instantly switch between dark and light canvas themes.
- **SVG Export**: Auto-generates production-ready SVG code for your widget. Copy to clipboard with one click.
- **Save & Privacy**: Save widgets to your dashboard, set them as private, and tag them for easy organization.
- **Undo/Redo**: Robust history management for all canvas actions.

### Portfolio Dashboard
- **Profile Integration**: Connect your GitHub account and display widgets on your portfolio page.
